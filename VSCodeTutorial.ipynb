    "## What is Visual Studio Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer, we need a code editor to help us run the code script. Code editor is one of the most important parts of our setup. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free code editor which runs on the macOS, Linux and Windows operating systems. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).\n",
